# Custom `Exporter` for OCaml and the Jupyter NBConvert

Installing this Python project allow to convert [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.jupyter.org/) written with the [OCaml Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/akabe/ocaml-jupyter/) directly to well-written `.ml` OCaml scripts. It solves [this issue](https://github.com/akabe/ocaml-jupyter/issues/58#issuecomment-334730337).

## a) Test, and install locally
Clone this repository, test everything locally if you want, and then install it globally with:

```bash
$ python setup.py install  # for default Python
$ python3 setup.py install  # for Python3 if needed
```

> Note: `sudo` right might be necessary:

```bash
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

## b) Install directly from GitHub

This package can also be installed directly from GitHub with [`pip`](http://pip.pypa.io/):

```bash
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/Naereen/Jupyter-NBConvert-OCaml
```

Check that you use pip2 or pip3 whether you installed Jupyter for Python 2 or Python 3. (You can of course install `Jupyter-NBConvert-OCaml` for both if you prefer!)

## Use it

```bash
$ jupyter nbconvert --to ocaml A_Jupyter_notebook_with_OCaml_kernel.ipynb
$ ls A_Jupyter_notebook_with_OCaml_kernel.ml
...
$ ocaml A_Jupyter_notebook_with_OCaml_kernel.ml  # it works and comments are kept
...
```

To test it locally (in this folder), use [this Makefile](Makefile):

```bash
$ make convert_demo_ocaml_local
$ head -n7 demo_notebook_ocaml.ml

## Example

- See [this small notebook](demo_notebook_ocaml.ipynb), with lots of comments,
- [This first OCaml file](demo_notebook_script.ml) is the result of `jupyter-nbconvert --to script`, the default conversion, which removes all comments,
- [And this second OCaml file](demo_notebook_ocaml.ml) is the result of `jupyter-nbconvert --to ocaml`, our home-made conversion, which removes keep all comments and adds a small header.
